# Webservice with PHP

This is a webservice made with PHP.
It has full CRUD. (Create, read, update and delete)
It contains the courses that I have studied at Mittuniversitetet. 

#### There are two classes and a file that calls them.
The Database-class contains functions for connecting and closing connection to the database. That file is also used for storing database-settings which are used in a function in that class. 

The Courses-class contains functions for reading courses, creating courses, updating courses and deleting courses.

## Please note!!!
This code does not contain the right password to the database. In order to try this code you have to make your own database-settings.
